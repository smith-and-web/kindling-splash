# Kindling

> Kindling is a free, open-source desktop writing application that bridges the gap between outlining and drafting. Built for novelists, screenwriters, and fiction writers who plan before they write. Import outlines from Plottr, yWriter, or Obsidian Longform; draft with your scene beats visible as expandable prompts; export to DOCX or Markdown. Built with Rust and Tauri for Windows, macOS, and Linux. MIT licensed. All data stays local on your machine.
